%description
Take on the role of the Infernal Contractor and raise mayhem in this
fast-moving office simulation. This episode sees you racing round the
office against the clock in an attempt to prove your fitness to the
demanding recruiters. Slippery floors and dodgy ergonomics are all that
stand between you and gainful employment. Hear encouraging phone calls
from your agent, the harsh judgements of the recruiters, and the final
countdown as you race for the finish line in this interactive simulation.

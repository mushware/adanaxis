.SH NAME
adanaxisgpl \- Action game in 4 spatial dimensions
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B adanaxisgpl [--safe] [--recover] [--doc] [--help] [commands]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Documentation for this command can be found in the
About Adanaxis PDF, which is installed in the documentation area (usually /usr/share/doc/adanaxisgpl-<version>).

This is the GPL version of the game - other versions may be available.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "--help"
Displays help.
.IP "--doc"
Opens the program documentation, if possible.
.IP "--safe, --recover"
Start in 'recovery mode'.  This option resets the configuration to a very basic one, and disables program features that may cause problems.  After quitting, the game can be restarted normally by omitting this option and features re-enabled via the program Options menu.
.IP commands
Commands are passed to the internal intepreter.  If no commands are given, the program executes the start.txt file from its system directory (usually /usr/share/adanaxisgpl/system).

Infernal Contractor II
======================

Take the role of the Software Contractor and raise mayhem in this office
simulation.

Please report bugs and problems using http://sourceforge.net/projects/ic2/.

Game Manual
===========

After a fine performance in your job interview you find yourself on the brink
of profitable employment.  Yet the company are doubting your fitness for the
job, and want you to pass a medical before they sign on the line.  With the
medical staff on sick leave, their only alternative is to time you as you
run around the office.

They've set up various observation points around the office, which you have
pass in the order 1-2-3-1-2... and so on.

Arrow keys : move forward, backward, left and right
Mouse      : rotate player
Escape     : Exit back to the desktop
- and =    : Change display mode
p          : Pause
q          : Quit the current game to start a new one

Displays
--------

The complicated profusion of time displays are:

Top right, from the top down:
  Time remaining
  Lap record for the current attempt (appears after the first lap)
  Lap time so far

Top left:
  Lap count
  Split time record for this attempt and section (appears after the first lap)
  Split time so far

Task completion times:
  Small yellow: Lap time
  Big yellow:   Difference between lap time and best so far
  Small yellow: Split time
  Big yellow:   Difference between split time and best so far

Some game options can be altered by changing the configuration file directly,
named system/start.txt in the installation directory.  Installers will create
a link to the configuration file.

System requirements
===================

IC2 uses OpenGL for rendering, so will benefit greatly from a 3D graphics
card.  If performance is slow, there are two things to try:

1. Reduce the display quality to low in the configuration file.
2. Reduce the display size.

On a fast machine with 3D graphics support, display size can be increased
and display quality set to high.

Diagnostic output
=================

If things go wrong, diagnostic output is written to the terminal which
started the application (if there is one), the console (MacOS X), or the
files stderr.txt and stdout.txt in the ic2 system directory (win32).

Pressing the m key will cycle through the diagnostic overlay.  Displays are
collision checking, the permeabiliy map, adhesion map and lighting maps.

Pressing the n key with toggle the frame rate display.

Contract Designer Manual
========================

IC2 contains an in-game cheap and cheerful contract designer (like a level
designer).  Contracts are edited using copy and paste.

Key controls
------------

d - enter and exit the designer from the game
F1 - editing screen for the contract
F2 - second copy of the contract
F3 - template screen
F4 - scratch screen
1,2,3, etc. - Toggle the active tiers
z - undo
v - redo
s - save the contract
p - dump data to the console
arrow keys - move around
- and = - zoom
, and . - move selected area up and down tiers
left mouse button - paste (select in screens F2 upwards)
middle mouse button - move map around by dragging
right mouse button - select area by dragging

For Mac users, alt-click does the middle button and command-click does the
right button.  There are 8 levels of undo/redo, and things will wrap around
harmlessly if you go beyond that.

Preparing a contract for editing
--------------------------------

Take a look at the contract.xml file for the level to be edited.  Read the
comments; various things may need uncommenting in the script section before
the designer can be used.  To create a new level, copy an existing one.  The
file should refer to the tile and map files used by the contract.  A few
things, like the size of the map, need editing by hand in the map file.

Editing
-------

Goes like this:

1.  Find the element you want to copy on any of the screens.  Navigate around
using the arrow keys or by dragging with the middle button.
2.  Select the area by dragging a box with the right mouse button.  The
selected are will flash.
3.  Return to the editing screen using F1, if you're not already there.
4.  Left-click on the bottom left corner of the area you want to paste to.
5.  Repeat 1-4 as necessary.
6.  Save the contract by pressing s.
7.  Press p to return to gameplay to test the contract.

Tiers
-----

Tiers take a bit of getting used to.  Map details are seperated into tiers like this:

1 - floor
2 - floor details
3 - tables
4 - table details
5 - walls and lights

So when you cut and paste, only the active tiers are pasted, which is handy for
putting details on the floor and so on.

You can move things up and down tiers, but then things are getting tricky.

Lights
------

Lights are currently invisible tiles on tier 5.

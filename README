Infernal Contractor II
======================

A video game reflecting the insidious world of the software contractor.

Please report bugs and problems using http://sourceforge.net/projects/ic2/.

Game Manual
===========

There's no gameplay as yet, but a few keys will work.

Arrow keys - move forward, backward, left and right
Mouse x axis - rotate player
Escape - exit

Game options can be altered by changing the configuration file directly,
named system/start.txt in the installation directory.  Installers will create
a link to the configuration file.

System requirements
===================

IC2 uses OpenGL for rendering, so will benefit greatly from a 3D graphics
card.  If performance is slow, there are two things to try:

1. Reduce the display quality to low in the configuration file.
2. Reduce the display size.

On a fast machine with 3D graphics support, display size can be increased
and display quality set to high.

Diagnostic output
=================

If things go wrong, diagnosting output is written to the termianl which started the application (if there is one), the console (MacOS X), of the files stderr.txt and stdout.txt in the ic2 system directory (win32).

Pressing the m key will toggle the collision checking diagnostic overlay.

Contract Designer Manual
=======================

IC2 contains an in-game cheap and cheerful contract designer (like a level designer).  Contracts are edited using copy and paste.

Key controls
------------

d - enter designer from game
p - return to game from designer
F1 - Editing screen for the contract
F2 - Second copy of the contract
F3 - Template screen
z - undo
v - redo
s - save the contract
arrow keys - move around
left mouse button - paste (select in screens F2 upwards)
middle mouse button - move map around by dragging
right mouse button - select area by dragging

For Mac users, alt-click does the middle button and command-click does the right button.  There are 8 levels of undo/redo, and things will wrap around harmlessly if you go beyond that.

Preparing a contract for editing
--------------------------------

Take a look at the contract.xml file for the level to be edited.  Read the comments; various things may need uncommenting in the script section before the designer can be used.  To create a new level, copy an existing one.  The file should refer to the tile and map files used by the contract.  A few things, like the size of the map, need editing by hand in the map file.

Editing
-------

Goes like this:

1.  Find the element you want to copy on any of the screens.  Navigate around using the arrow keys or by dragging with the middle button.
2.  Select the area by dragging a box with the right mouse button.  The selected are will flash.
3.  Return to the editing screen using F1, if you're not already there.
4.  Left-click on the bottom left corner of the area you want to paste to.
5.  Repeat 1-4 as necessary.
6.  Save the contract by pressing s.
7.  Press p to return to gameplay to test the contract.

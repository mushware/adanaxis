To build for Windows using Visual C++

A project is available in the VisualC directory.  A cygwin installation
will still be required to generate the release using make win32-release.

To build for Windows using cygwin

** The cygwin build has not been maintained since ddraw.h was added
** to the main build.

Install cygwin from cygwin.com
Install the package MSYS from mingw.org in its default location
Install the package MingW from mingw.org in its default location
Edit /cygwin/etc/profile and place the MingW directory at the start of the path.  e.g.

PATH="/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:$PATH"

becomes

PATH="/cygdrive/c/MinGW/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:$PATH"

Add the path to your DLLs to the PATH environment variable.  Add this to .bashrc in your cygwin home directory:
PATH=$PATH:$HOME/core-app/win32/win32libs
export PATH

Ensure that any DLLs in the distribution are executable, e.g. chmod +x win32/win32libs.

Remove MingW's ar.exe from the path, e.g. mv C:/MingW/bin/ar.exe C:/MingW/bin/mingw-ar.exe
Remove MingW's ranlib.exe from the path, e.g. mv C:/MingW/bin/ranlib.exe C:/MingW/bin/mingw-ranlib.exe
Rename cygwin's pcre and expat libraries.

Build or get the required libraries using this environment.  Use

./configure --prefix=C:/MinGW --build=i686-pc-mingw32 --target=i686-pc-mingw32

to place them in the MingW search path.  Most packages are available at http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/, or failing that http://mingwrep.sourceforge.net/.  Precompiled GLUT can be found in the file glutming.zip at http://mywebpage.netscape.com/PtrPck/glut.htm.  Libraries which do not need to be dynamically linked should be built with --enable-shared=no.

You may need to patch libogg as per http://www.xiph.org/archives/vorbis-dev/200212/0009.html.

Rename /MinGW/bin/i686-pc-mingw32-sdl-config to sdl-config if necessary

Some libraries will fail to build their example applications because of Cygwin/MinGW path differences.  So long as the library builds, use make -i to ignore the errors.

Errors:

0xC000022 on application startup:  Permision denied.  Typically a DLL which doesn't have execute permission.
When building libraries, libtool may expand library paths by prepending /usr/lib.  For now, remove or rename the offending libraries is cygwin's /usr/lib (usually expat and pcre).

Use make win32-release to generate an installer.  This requires the
NSIS package.

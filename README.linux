README for Linux

Building from source on Mandrake Linux 8.2
==========================================

These instructions are based on building Mushware source on a Mandrake Linux
installation.  Mandrake Linux 8.2 was installed using the default settings.

The glxinfo command should print information, and not tell you that GLX is
disabled.  If it does, you may have to add a line loading the glx module
to the file /etc/XF86Config.

Download the files <app-name>-<version>.tar.gz into your home directory.

tar xvzf <app-name>-<version>.tar.gz
cd <app-name>-<version>
./configure

Configure is likely to fail first time round, but it will tell you what's
missing..  The following steps were required for configure to complete.

Open the software manager from Start Menu->Configuration->Packaging->Software
Manager.  Search for and install the following packages, and allow the
software manager to install the dependencies.

gcc-c++
XFree86-devel
libMesaGLU1-devel
libMesaglut3-devel
libpcre0-devel
libexpat1_95-devel
libungif4-devel
libtiff3-devel
libSDL1.2-devel
libalsa1-devel
libesound0-devel
libsmpeg0.4-devel
libogg0-devel
libvorbis0-devel
libSDL_mixer1.2-devel

Then

./configure
make
make install

Building from source on RedHat Linux 7.3
========================================

These instructions are based on building the Mushware source on a RedHat Linux
installation.  RedHat Linux 7.3 was installed using the 'GNOME' setting.

Download the files <app-name>-<version>.tar.gz into your home directory.

tar xvzf <app-name>-<version>.tar.gz
cd <app-name>-<version>
./configure

Configure is likely to fail first time round, but it will tell you what's
missing..  The following steps were required for configure to complete.

Insert the RedHat CD 2.  Answer 'Yes' when asked to run autorun, or run it
manually.  Gnome RPM should start.  Choose Operations->Install... from the
menu.  This application reads package details from the CD in the background,
so the file list may take a while to complete.  Install the following
packages:

Development->Languages->cpp-2.96-110
Development->Languages->gcc-2.96-110
Development->Languages->gcc-c++-2.96-110
Development->Libraries->glibc-devel-2.2.5-34
Development->Libraries->libstdc++-devel-2.96-110
Development->System->glibc-kernheaders-2.4-7.14
Development->Tools->binutils-2.1.1.93.0.2-11

Development->Libraries->XFree86-devel-4.2.0-8
System Environment->Libraries->glut-3.7-4
Development->Libraries->glut-devel-3.7-4

Development->Libraries->pcre-devel-3.9-2
Development->Libraries->expat-devel-1.95.2-2
Development->Libraries->libungif-devel-4.1.0-10
Development->Libraries->libtiff-devel-3.5.7-2
Development->Libraries->SDL-devel-1.2.3-7
Development->Libraries->smpeg-devel-0.4.4-9
Development->Libraries->libogg-devel-1.0rc3-1
Development->Libraries->libvorbis-devel-1.0rc3-1
Development->Libraries->SDL_mixer-devel-1.2.1-4

If the installers issues a warning about dependencies, find those packages
and install the as well.

./configure
make
make install

Building from source on SUSE Linux personal 8.0
===============================================

These instructions are based on building the Mushware source on a SUSE Linux
installation.  SUSE Linux 8.0 was installed using the 'Default + office'
setting.

Use the command 3Ddiag to check that your system is correctly configured
for 3D rendering.  The glxinfo command should print information, and not
tell you that GLX is disabled.

Download the files <app-name>-<version>.tar.gz into your home directory.

tar xvzf <app-name>-<version>.tar.gz
cd <app-name>-<version>
./configure

Configure is likely to fail first time round, but it will tell you what's
missing..  The following steps were required for configure to complete.

Open the YAST2 application from Start Menu->System->YAST2
(enter password as prompted)
Choose Install/Remove software
Install the following packages:
 Development/Tools -> package make
 Development/Languages/C and C++ -> package gcc
 Development/Languages/C and C++ -> package gpp
 Development/Libraries/X11 -> package xdevel
 Development/Libraries/X11 -> package expat
 Development/Libraries/C and C++ -> package alsa-devel
 Development/Libraries/C and C++ -> package esound-devel
 Development/Libraries/C and C++ -> package vorbis-devel
 Productivity/Multimedia/Video/Players -> package smpeg
 System/Libraries -> package SDL_mixer

Install the mesa, SDL, smpeg and ogg devel packages.  Couldn't find these
on my CD, so got them from:

(Paste the URL into Konqueror, click 'Open' when asked to 'Open using
KPackage'.  Click 'Install' when KPackage starts.)

./configure
make
make install

Generating RPMs
===============

Install the rpm-build package if necessary.

mkdir -p ~/rpm/{BUILD,RPMS/i586,RPMS/noarch,SOURCES,SRPMS,SPECS,tmp}

# Create these files:

rm -f ~/.rpmrc
echo buildarchtranslate: i386: i586 >> ~/.rpmrc
echo buildarchtranslate: i486: i586 >> ~/.rpmrc
echo buildarchtranslate: i586: i586 >> ~/.rpmrc
echo buildarchtranslate: i686: i586 >> ~/.rpmrc


rm -f ~/.rpmmacros
echo %_topdir               $HOME/rpm >> ~/.rpmmacros
echo %_tmppath              $HOME/rpm/tmp >> ~/.rpmmacros
echo %_signature            gpg >> ~/.rpmmacros
echo %_gpg_name             <app-name> >> ~/.rpmmacros
echo %_gpg_path             ~/.gnupg >> ~/.rpmmacros
echo %distribution          <app-name> >> ~/.rpmmacros

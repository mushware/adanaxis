<h2>Infernal Contractor II version 0.0.4-2</h2>
<p>Take on the role of the software contractor and raise mayhem in this office simulation.  This first stage sees you racing around the office against the clock in an attempt to convince people of your fitness.</p>
<h3>Release notes</h3>
<p>This software is a beta test.  Please see the <a href="http://www.mushware.com/">web site</a> or installed README file for details.  Please report any bugs or problems at the IC2 <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ic2/">SourceForge project</a>.  To uninstall, delete the Infernal Contractor II directory</p>
<h3>Known bugs</h3>
<p>On machines without working 3D accelerators (like my G3/300MHz) the game will not work in fullscreen mode.  If you have one of these, the game wil fade the screen three times whilst attempting to select a mode, and then give up.  To get some limited operation, edit the configuration file start.txt to use windowed mode.  The latest libsdl (<a href="http://www.libsdl.org">http://www.libsdl.org</a>) might resolve the problem - something after version 1.2.4.</p>

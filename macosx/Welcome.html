<h2>Infernal Contractor II version 0.0.4</h2>

<h3>Release notes</h3>
<p>This software is a beta test.  Please see the <a href="http://www.mushware.co.uk/ic2/">web site</a> or installed README file for details.  Please report any bugs or problems at the IC2 <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ic2/">SourceForge project</a>.  To uninstall, delete the Infernal Contractor II directory</p>
<h3>Known bugs</h3>
<p>On machines without working 3D accelerators (like my G3/300MHz) the game will not work in fullscreen mode.  If you have one of these, the game wil fade the screen three times whilst attempting to select a mode, and then give up.  To get some limited operation, edit the configuration file start.txt to use windowed mode.  The latest libsdl (<a href="http://www.libsdl.org">http://www.libsdl.org</a>) might resolve the problem - something after version 1.2.4.  This installer has not been tested on MacOS X 10.2</p>

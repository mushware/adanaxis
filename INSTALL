To compile and install Infernal Contractor II from this distribution:

Unix/POSIX/Linux/FreeBSD
========================

Download and unpack the source and data files thus:

tar xvzf ic2-src-0_0_3.tar.gz
cd ic2-0.0.3
tar xvzf ic2-data-0_0_3.tar.gz

Run

./configure
(spend a few days getting the libraries which configure asks for)
make
make install

The application will be installed into to ic2data directory, not in the /usr tree.
It can then be run using

./ic2

MacOS X
=======

Install using the MacOS X installer from http://www.mushware.co.uk/ic2

Compile using the project builder file core-app.pbproj.  To build the
installer, use

make mac-release

and follow the instructions.  This will require a checkout of the
macosxlibs module from the CVS server or a set of your own libraries.

win32
=====

Install using the win32 installer from http://www.mushware.co.uk/ic2

Build using cygwin/mingw32.  Both cygwin and mingw32 should be installed,
with mingw32 paths appearing before cygwin so that the mingw32 compiler
is used.  Then build as for POSIX above.

To build the installer, ensure that nullsoft.com's makensis.exe is visible
in your path.  Place the required DLLs in win32/win32libs or get them via
CVS.  Then use

make win32-release

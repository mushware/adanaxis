Platform-specific details can be found in README.linux, README.win32 and
README.macosx files.

To compile and install Adanaxis from this distribution:

Unix/POSIX/Linux/FreeBSD
========================

Download and unpack the source and data files and build thus:

tar xvzf adanaxis-1.1.4.tar.gz
cd adanaxis-1.1.4
./configure
# (spend a few days getting the libraries that configure asks for)
make
make install
adanaxis

Alternatively, the application can be started without installing.  In this
case the data path enviroment variable must be set.  For example:

make
export adanaxis_DATA_DIR=$HOME/adanaxis-1.1.4/data-adanaxis
src/adanaxis

Mac OS X
========

The application should run directly from the disk image, obtainable from
http://www.mushware.com/, or:

Compile using the Xcode file macosx/project/project.xcodeproj.
To build the release, use

make mac-release

and follow the instructions.  This will require a checkout of the
macosxlibs module from the CVS server or a set of your own libraries.

win32
=====

Install using the win32 installer from http://www.mushware.com/, or:

Build using Visual Studio .NET 2003.  The project file can be found in the
VisualC directory (project/project.sln).

To build the installer, ensure that nullsoft.com's makensis.exe is visible
in your path.  Place the required DLLs in win32/win32libs or get them via
CVS.  Then use

make win32-release
